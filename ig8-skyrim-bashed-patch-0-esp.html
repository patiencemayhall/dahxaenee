I got into modding a week ago and it's been crash after crash and troubleshooting after that and when I finally get the game running, I crash as soon as I enter one of the most important parts of my mage run.

Compatibility: This is an automated version of SkyFem by Corsec and will automatically feminize your Skyrim world and patch your mod list for you.; Should be compatible with most mod guides, I have verified compatibility with Lexy's LOTD SE guide (which is one of the largest and most complicated guides that exist right now) and have not experienced any crashes. Game will not load any further than main menu, if i hit Load or New game, the starting music plays but I am still stuck on the main menu. I checked my task manager and Skyrim was only using 50% of my computers memory at that time. This problem has persisted even after turning off my mods, and I do have the memory patch, Crash fixes, Infinite loading screen fix,safety load, and the memory block logs enabled, which show normal results. amp#x200B; LOAD ORDER amp#x200B; 0 0 Skyrim.e.

 Hey folks, So for some inexplicable reason, Skyrim Special Edition started crashing today. First it began with crashing whenever I'd approach Whiterun which quickly stopped after loading a save from 30 minutes before. Now it's changed to crashing whenever I leave whatever cave or dungeon I'm in and try to get to the main world map. Anyway, I'm terrible with stuff like this so I just wanted to know if there was anything someone much smarter than I could see that I'm missing.

Ever since I started modding my Skyrim SE the whole thing , while not unpleseant, has been an exercise in utter futility for me, troubleshooting problems that remained unsolved, doing fresh reinstalls updated, unistalled potentially unstable mods, having to ditch advanced characters to start fresh just to check is something was amiss because the freezes and crashes would simply not stop. But I have reach my proverbial limit. This will be the last time I will try to troubleshoot whats wrong. About Mod Organizer.

Hello all. amp#x200B; I'm running Classic Skyrim, with 211 plugins. I use NMM to do the managing, Loot to sort things out, and I do my best to read most instructions. I managed a pretty stable game, I'd say, playing almost 30 hours on easter's holiday, without a single crash, and most everything seems to be running smoothly. amp#x200B; Except, I noticed a problem, that I should have noticed early. I'm running with some problem with the Perkus Maximus Perma Patches. I have some armors. おすすめMODの紹介 † ¶ OblivionプレーヤがすすめるMODを紹介するものです。 注意事項 発売からかなりの年月が経過しているせいで、ここに掲載されているMODには既にあまり使われなくなった古い時代の物も含まれています。. 
Second time having to type this, so you'll have to forgive if its crass. amp#x200B; So I'm dealing with a save corruption issue, have been testing and working on it for weeks now and I have officially ran out of ideas to try and resolve it. This is not the permanent, "your game is screwed" type of corruption. This is the corruption where all the scripts break, dialog does not trigger, and dialog boxes do not appear, but if I quit and reopen Skyrim, I can load that save fine. I have been experiencing random ctd usually at exteriors but also sometimes loading in. amp#x200B; 16gb ram intel i7-8700 cpu @ 3.2 ghz nvidia geforce gtx 1070ti 8gb amp#x200B; 1st log \ 04/03/2019 - 06:56:41PM\ Papyrus log opened (PC)\ 04/03/2019 - 06:56:41PM\ Function GetEffectMagnitudes in the empty state on type Ingredient does not exist.

Following the advice of some members of the community, I gave up trying to figure out moding by myself and followed a Guide: Lexy's: Legacy of The Dragonborn Special Edition to be more specific. Whether this was a wise descision or not is something that I question now -\_- https://wiki.step-project.com/User:DarkladyLexy/Lexys\_LOTD\_SE (https://wiki.step-project.com/User:DarkladyLexy/Lexys_LOTD_SE) I have spent nearly a month following the guide best I could and mere hours This is my mod list. Its working pretty well, actually: no crashes, no issues with textures, everything looks beautiful and runs very smoothly. I've run into one big problem though: some vanilla quests won't work correct. For example, I could not continue A Walking Nightmare because the priest would not follow me, the first time I talk to Jarl Elisif she says "There is something personal you can do for me" even though I have not completed "The Man Who Cried Wolf", and Potema would not speak. So I am doing another run of Skyrim SE\ as I never completed it\ with multiple mods installed\ they are stable and smooth and have worked good before\  As usual I started with a sneak and archer build\ Will abandon it after reaching legendary\ and reached Bleak Falls Barrow, as I left the game after a quick save the Bow damage is downgraded to ere 4-7\ 7 being maximum\ while th erest of weapons and spells are working fine. So any work around the to fix this issue? P.S My load Order-. So i've been modding my skyrim vr game for about a week now and i've got a surprisingly stable game with over 300 mods installed. One issue i'm having however is that my solitude guards are all not wearing any body armor (even on new saved games). So i loaded up my whole load order in ssedit and went exploring. Ended up with this. https://imgur.com/a/SYtYfoi (https://imgur.com/a/SYtYfoi)  Now i'm unsure how to read it. Is it the error? If so how does that even happen with a bashed patch. Hi all -- For my Skyrim VR, I've painstakingly crafted a lovely 100+ collection of mods that appear to work well together. The only thing sticking in my craw is that \ every time\ I fire up the game, all of the mods do their initial load-up process. It takes a long time, especially for mods that add naughty animations. I've clocked it around at least 5 minutes. Is this the expected behavior? Do I need to wait 5 minutes each time I fire up the game? Do things ever get loaded I have used loot to check my order, I have cleaned my mods using tesedit, and I made sure I have all the dependencies. Not sure what is causing me to crash at this point. would love help thanks. \----------------------------------Load order---------------------------- 0 0 Skyrim.esm 1 1 Update.esm 2 2 Dawnguard.esm 3 3 HearthFires.esm 4 4 Dragonborn.esm 5 5 Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch.esp 6 6 SexLab.esm 7 7 SexLabAroused.esm. 
I haven't had any conflicts so far, after I became a Vampire Lord, I tried to use IAFT to turn Lydia, and now her face won't move even to speak. Loading a save, spawning a new Lydia, downloading expression mods, and "MFG" console command does not fix the problem, but making a new game does. I would really like to fix this file if possible, but this is totally ruining my immersion.

Ahoy hoy, I hope I have come to the right place to ask for help. I recently re-installed Skyrim Special Edition, and decided to follow the Nordic Skyrim guide to mods. I used most of the same mods the author did, with some slight changes and additions here and there. Now, I can play the game fine when out in the wilderness or in caves and such, as well as small towns. However whenever I enter a major city like Solitude or Windhelm, I CTD after taking a few steps. I'm not very savvy So what happens is I start up my test character, choose "Sleeping Giant Inn Patron" at the Statue of Mara from AS - LAL.everything is good when I load in, and then when I try to exist into Skyrim I get a CTD during the loading screen. Troubleshooting is yielding nothing but I'm fairly bad at troubleshooting.

Hi. After porting skytweaks on SE with this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EYxzW6I\_MM (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EYxzW6I_MM) , I can't get it to work. In fact in the MCM menu I want to increase base health NPC (+80) to make ennemy little bit stronger. But nothing to do, I 1or 2 shoot them all the time. I have wildcat and vigor installed. And a bunch of mods. I place skytweak very low on the load order (you can find it at the end.any clue ? Skyrim.esm Update.esm Dawnguar. Hello all, I've been having a problem that I hope you can help me out with (PC). I started the Dark Brotherhood questline and got to the point where you have to sleep to go to the Abandoned Shack. However, whenever I do, the game goes into an infinite loading loop. I wanted to see if this was a problem with sleeping to the shack or the shack itself, so I teleported to the shack (in a save before doing the Grelod the Kind quest) and I got the same bug. Afterward, I installed a mod which changed. 
So after letting myself into world of skyrim modding.I.screwed up badly, got brown faces with nearly every major NPC from all guilds. I've tried to lookup sthe solution so i get it that i have more than one appearance change mods, but the more I try to repair it, the more i screw it up. Any help?
